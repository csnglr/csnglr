I"<p>The College Singularity</p>

<p>As time progresses, the college admissions process has become increasingly competitive and expensive. Acceptance rates have dropped exponentially (over 60% in some cases) and the level of accomplishments that are expected have risen. Both qualitative and quantitative evidence have pointed towards the existence of a college singularity: <em>that if the current trend of increasing academic expectations and costs continue, there will exist a point where it will be impossible for non-affluent families to participate in the college admissions process beyond a local level.</em></p>

<p>The academic qualifications for today’s admissions process are strikingly more competitive than the past decades. Expected SAT scores have increased across-the-board, even in public schools such as the University of Michigan, which the 75th percentile SAT score rose from 1380 in 2000 (https://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/cds/cds_2000-2001_umaa.pdf) to 1530 in 2020(https://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/University-of-Michigan-SAT-scores-GPA). This is only one example, as nearly all the “top 30 universities” (T30s) have raised quantitative expectations:</p>

<p>This trend is shared amongst the High School GPA of prospective applicants. The quantitative expectations for top universities will continue to rise and restrict non-affluent families who cannot afford the resources to compete with the highly competitive demands. The typical student can simply not spend thousands on upper-end college counseling (most notably IvyCoach, which can provide almost guaranteed admission for prices such as $100,000 https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/08/10/elite-college-counseling-a-legal-prohibitively-expensive-pay-to-win-game-in-admissions/), giving the wealthy an immediate advantage. Universities’ use of legacy admissions further perpetuates the issue of top institutions being largely accessible by only affluent families. On a purely merit basis, it is easier for wealthier families to meet the quantitative criterion of top colleges, giving an unfair advantage in the admissions process.</p>

<p>However, a strong GPA and SAT score no longer guarantees a place in the top universities, as many institutions put extensive importance on qualitative extracurriculars. These institutions desire students that are uniquely qualified and interesting, such as “a filmmaker who has been published in Discovery and National Geographic, a developer of an electric car and bamboo bike, a racial justice activist leading campaign initiatives and conducting legislative policy, a researcher on underwater robot archaeology, a founder of a malaria youth intervention program in Ghana, an author of the bestselling book on Amazon in the category of Asian History for Young Adults, and an inventor of an artificial intelligence framework for air quality that has a provisional patent.” (https://hub.jhu.edu/2021/03/19/class-of-2025-regular-decision/)</p>

<p>While impressive, many of the competitive extracurriculars top colleges desire from students require resources (informational or physical) that are significantly harder to obtain for non-affluent families. Financial resources give an unfair advantage to many different aspects, such as advertising a new movement/club, costs for projects, access to mentors/tutors, easier access to research laboratories, etc.</p>

<p>Additionally, affluence can directly impact the ability and mental health of students. Students who are negatively affected by their financial situation can face significant stress compared to their wealthy counterparts, as the “distress affects brain development, academic success, and social competence “(http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may13/vol70/num08/How-Poverty-Affects-Classroom-Engagement.aspx)</p>

<p>To say students haven’t felt the brunt of the current system is foolish; online college admissions communities such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/search/?q=flair%3Arant&amp;restrict_sr=1">r/ApplyingToCollege</a> and <a href="https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/college-admissions/38/none">CollegeConfidential</a> are filled with thousands upon thousands of complaints about the application process.</p>

<p>Many parents fail to understand the extremely different environment that the college admissions process has become, (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mcycr1/im_so_tired_of_having_to_explain_to_my_parents/">ex1</a></p>

<p>A few direct anecdotes from students), as the system is nigh-unrecognizable since the last generation’s fruition. In 1992, Acceptance rates for the ivy-leagues averaged 25% in 1992, and now averages 8.7%.</p>

<p>Why this is bad &amp; how the singularity is created</p>

<p>Higher education is ultimately a business, and as long as there is a high demand for prestigious universities, the gates have no reason to move. Colleges have a small applicant pool; the less students they accept, the lower the acceptance rate and the shiner the brand name becomes. This becomes especially bad when the amount of students accepted decreases(https://www.studentclearinghouse.org/blog/fall-2020-college-enrollment-declines-2-5-nearly-twice-the-rate-of-decline-of-fall-2019/)</p>

<p>Even if colleges continuously increase their prices and decrease funding options, there will always be a steady stream of applicants eager to be accepted. Whether this group is composed of the middle or lower class is irrelevant, as competitive affluent students can fill the gaps formed by the economically disadvantaged.</p>

<p>As a result from lower acceptance rates, higher academic expectation, rising tuition, and lower class sizes, the college singularity is formed, where the middle and lower class is removed and replaced by the affluent.</p>

<p>Why we need your help</p>

<p>College admissions don’t receive enough coverage, especially in the current day. The College Singularity is an issue that must be brought to the lawmaker’s agenda. We don’t want donations or any contributions, we just want your help to share and gather awareness.</p>
